## Project Overview  
A third-party certification organization required statistical and physical proof to verify if confidential petrol formulations (with varying additives) exhibited significantly different burning patterns. This project:  
1. Analyzed additive data using parametric/non-parametric tests.  
2. Identified correlations and ANOVA results to quantify differences.  
3. Visualized distributions and relationships among additives.  
4. Applied K-means clustering to group formulations objectively.  

## Key Steps  
1. **Descriptive Analysis**:  
   - Checked normality and variance homogeneity.  
   - Calculated correlations and ran ANOVA tests.  
2. **Graphical Analysis**:  
   - Created histograms, boxplots and heatmaps for additive distributions.  
3. **Unsupervised Learning: Clustering**:  
   - Used K-means with elbow method to determine optimal clusters.
